# Abyss of Illusion

## Lore
What if everything you know is a lie?  
The Overworld, Nether, End... These so-called dimensions are artificial "World Bubbles," created by the so-called gods.  
In truth, these gods are not divine beings, but advanced ancestors of humanity who mastered the art of creation.

Using their unparalleled technology, they designed these World Bubbles to simulate natural laws and observe life’s progression.  
However, internal conflict among these "gods" led them to abandon the real world—the **Void Realm**.  
This chaotic and dangerous place, hidden behind the layers of the World Bubbles, is the only reality.

You, a lone wanderer, have stumbled into the **Godless Land**, a desolate space untouched by divine power.  
Starting with nothing, you must evolve from a primitive survivor to a master of technology.  
Uncover the lies, break through the walls of the World Bubbles, and enter the Void Realm to discover the truth of existence.

## Gameplay
### **1. Civilization Progression**
The mod introduces a complete civilization progression system based on realistic rules.  
Players will experience the journey from primitive survival to advanced technologies:
- **Stone Age**: Gather sticks and stones to craft basic tools. Use fire to survive and build simple shelters.
- **Agriculture and Metallurgy**: Develop farming, tame animals, smelt metals, and establish stable villages and production facilities.
- **Industrialization**: Harness natural energy (water, steam) to power machines and automate tasks.
- **High-Tech Era**: Research rift energy, develop advanced devices, and construct the gateway to the Void Realm.

Each stage introduces new challenges and breakthroughs, providing a rewarding sense of progression.

### **2. Exploration and Challenges**
Exploration is at the core of the mod. Players must gather resources and clues in both the Godless Land and other World Bubbles:
- **Godless Land**: A barren, dangerous area with limited resources but critical starting points for progression.
- **Rifted Dimensions**: The Overworld, Nether, and End hold secrets and resources needed to unlock the Void Realm.
- **Ruins of the Gods**: Scattered throughout the dimensions, these ruins contain ancient technologies and the truth of their downfall.

Players will also face environmental and hostile challenges:
- **Natural Threats**: Fire spreads, food decays, and buildings collapse without proper support.
- **Residual Divine Power**: Some areas are guarded by remnants of godly energy, requiring players to disable mysterious devices or fight powerful creatures.

### **3. Realistic Mechanics**
The mod dramatically overhauls Minecraft's core mechanics to enhance realism:
- **Resource Gathering**:
    - Players cannot punch trees to collect wood. Tools like stone axes must be crafted for efficiency.
    - Ores require specialized tools or explosives to extract.
- **Building and Environment**:
    - Structures require proper support or they will collapse under gravity.
    - Wooden buildings are highly flammable, requiring fireproofing strategies.
- **Food and Health**:
    - Food spoils over time, pushing players to build preservation systems like cold storage or drying racks.
    - Balanced diets are necessary to maintain health, and neglecting nutrition can lead to illness.

### **4. Freedom of Choice and Open Endings**
As players uncover the truth behind the World Bubbles, they will face significant choices:
- Shatter all World Bubbles and enter the chaotic Void Realm for ultimate freedom.
- Take control of the World Bubbles and become the new god, shaping the future of existence.
- Destroy all remnants of godly technology, allowing the world to return to its natural state.

Each decision will lead to different outcomes, shaping the future of the world and providing endless replayability.
